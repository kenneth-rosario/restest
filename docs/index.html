    <h2>Introductiion</h2>
    <p>
      RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs are interfaces that provide
      interoperability between computers over the Internet. It is widely used in
      a variety of applications that range from simple webpages to more complex
      applications like social media networks. Following a client-server model,
      it allows the access and manipulation of Web resources through a set of
      predefined stateless operations. For example, when using HTTP, operations
      like GET, PUT, POST and DELETE are predefined. An important step in
      implementing RESTful APIs is testing. This way the correctness of the APIs
      operations can be assured, as well as the correctness of the layers
      beneath it. To this avail, many libraries provide functionalities that
      enable the making of tests for an implementation of a REST API. However,
      some of these libraries can be involved and confusing, making developers
      spend large amounts of time just learning how to use the library. RESTest
      is a programming language created for RESTful API testing. It aims to
      provide high-level functionalities that simplify test-making while having
      a minimal learning curve. This way, developers can focus on making tests,
      as opposed to figuring out how to make them. Many of its features follow
      the functional programming model which helps reinforce the simplicity of
      the language and allow it to do more with fewer lines of code.

    <h2>Motivations</h2>
    <p>
      The need for a simple way to test REST APIs came to be as most of our team
      members were building APIs in that same semester, ICOM4036/CIIC4030 and a
      Motivations tool to automate testing the RESTest was born.
